We’ve all heard the age-old phrase “love yourself,” but what does it truly mean to do so?  
Is it about treating yourself to a special day out or indulging in your favorite activities?  
Or perhaps it’s about finding happiness in solitude?  
While these experiences can be part of the journey, self-love is much more than that.

Self-love is loving yourself — spreading that love, compassion, and positivity that you feel within to everyone around you — and also being at peace with yourself, not letting any external factor affect your peace and happiness.

When there’s self-hatred, there can’t be self-love. Demolishing that self-hatred is very difficult; the only way is to cultivate self-love. Based on my experiences and learning, I’ve summed up what I believe to be the process:

## 1. Forgive and appreciate yourself  
Often, self-hatred arises from not accepting reality. Maybe you made a mistake, did something hurtful, failed at something, or were rejected — these can make you feel worthless or question your identity. How to deal with that?  

Think of this — a builder spent a long time building a wall with 1000 bricks. But when he finished, he noticed two bricks placed poorly, and he felt disappointed. Every time he looked at the wall, he couldn’t stop focusing on the two bad bricks, ignoring the 998 that were perfect. One day, a stranger came and complimented the beauty of the wall. Surprised, the builder asked if the stranger was blind because he couldn’t see the two bad bricks. The stranger responded with compassion: “I am not blind, sir, you are. You’re only seeing the two bad bricks and ignoring the 998 beautifully placed ones.”  

We all make mistakes — and sometimes, like the builder, we focus solely on them and overlook all the good things we’ve done. So next time you make a mistake — be kind to yourself. Learn, grow, and appreciate your good deeds. That’s the first step to self-love and self-compassion.

## 2. Practice gratitude  
Gratitude can bring a big positive change. I strongly recommend keeping a journal. Every day after you come home, just write down three things you’re grateful for — even small things: tying your shoelaces, being able to ride your bike to work, or simply being able to breathe.  

With regular practice, this habit helps you see positivity even during hard times. Over time, even when facing problems, you will start spotting good things automatically. Gratitude boosts self-esteem, positivity, and replaces anger or negativity with kindness, empathy, and calmness.

## 3. Accept and be yourself  
Often we are dissatisfied, always craving more. This endless cycle of desire can make us feel inadequate. But we must remember — nobody is perfect. We are all beautiful with our flaws.  

A story I learned: There was a disciple seeking the “perfect tree” — straight bark, perfect leaves, flawless branches. He searched but could not find one. Tree after tree had some imperfections. The master finally said: “There is no such perfect tree. The crooked, scarred ones are the most beautiful.”  

Likewise, we’re humans — flawed, imperfect. Understanding and accepting ourselves, embracing our flaws instead of ignoring them, that’s how we become beautiful. Don’t try to be someone else — just be yourself.

### Summary  
- Forgive and appreciate yourself for your mistakes and growth.  
- Practice gratitude daily — celebrate small things.  
- Accept yourself, flaws and all — that’s your true beauty.  

You are amazing just the way you are.
